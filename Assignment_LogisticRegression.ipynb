As one <a href=\"https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/red-cross-in-blood-donation-crisis\">prominent</a> example, blood donations slow down during busy holiday seasons. An accurate forecast for the future supply of blood allows for an appropriate action to be taken ahead of time and therefore saving more lives.</p>\n",
        "<p>In this notebook, we explored  model selection using regularization and hyper parameter tuning.  We try for better than simply choosing <code>0</code> all the time (the target incidence suggests that such a model would have 76% success rate). We then normalized our training data and __________ the accuracy . In the field of machine learning, even small improvements in accuracy can be important, depending on the purpose.</p>\n",
        "<p>Another benefit of using logistic regression model is that it is interpretable. We can analyze how much of the variance in the response variable (<code>target</code>) can be explained by other variables in our dataset.</p>"
